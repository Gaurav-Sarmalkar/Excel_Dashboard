# Bank Churn Dashboard (Interactive dashboard created using MS Excel)
## Project Objective 
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer churn behavior for a retail bank using historical customer data. The goal is to identify patterns and key factors contributing to customer attrition, and to develop an interactive Excel dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore churn trends across various customer segments such as geography, age, tenure, product usage, and account activity.
## Key Goals
1. Measure overall churn rate and identify high-risk customer segments.
2. Compare churn behavior by demographic attributes like gender, geography, and age.
3. Analyze financial indicators (e.g., balance, credit score, estimated salary) in relation to churn.
4. Understand behavioral factors, such as product usage, card ownership, and activity level.
5. Enable dynamic filtering of the dashboard using slicers for deep dives into subsets of customers.
## KPI's
Total customers associated with the bank.
Total churned customers out of all the customers.
Total retained customers out of all the customers.
Churn rate percentage across for both male and female across bank.
